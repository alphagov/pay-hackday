# Pay Hackday

*NodeJS boilerplate and resources for GOV.UK Hack Day*

Application skeleton for the most basic NodeJS web application that
developers can use during the Pay Hack Day to quickly bootstrap a
hypothetical GOV.UK service. The seed is pre-configured to install the
necessary libraries needed to complete the exercise of integrating
with GOV.UK Pay, GOV.UK Notify and deploying on GOV.UK PaaS.

## Running GOV.UK Pay sample service
```
npm install
npm start
```
